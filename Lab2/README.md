# Lab2: Introduction to Combinational Circuits

## Lab in Class

- **8-bit Unsigned Ripple-Carry Adder**: Gate-level hierarchical implementation with overflow detection
- **8×8-bit Unsigned Multiplier**: Gate-level hierarchical structure for 8-bit multiplication

## Homework

- **Prob. A - 8-bit Unsigned ALU**: 
  - Implements addition and multiplication operations
  - Gate-level implementation with mode selection
  
- **Prob. B - Find First One (FFO)**: 
  - Detects the position of the first '1' bit from LSB
  - Outputs position and valid signal
  
- **Prob. C - 4-bit × 6 Merge Sort**: 
  - Hardware implementation of merge sort algorithm
  - Uses hierarchical comparator units
