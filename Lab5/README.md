  - Moore machine for pattern detection in ASCII character stream
  - Multiple pattern counters with termination detection

- **Prob. B - Factorial Calculator**:
  - Mealy machine for factorial computation
  - Configurable level with sequential multiplication

- **Prob. C - Washing Machine Controller**:
  - FSM-based controller with payment mechanism
  - Configurable timing and refund logic
