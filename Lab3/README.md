# Lab3: Advanced Arithmetic Circuits and Synthesis

## Lab in Class

- **32-bit ALU**: Multi-function arithmetic logic unit supporting 12 operations including arithmetic (ADD, SUB), logical (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR), comparison (SLT, SLTU), and special operations (ABS, BITREV) with overflow detection

## Homework

- **Prob. A-1 - Unsigned Fixed-Point Multiplier**:
  - Fixed-point multiplication with banker's rounding (round to nearest, ties to even)

- **Prob. A-2 - Signed Fixed-Point Multiplier**:
  - Signed fixed-point arithmetic with two's complement
  - Uses round to nearest, ties away from zero

- **Prob. B - Logarithmic Interpolation**:
  - Hardware implementation of log₂(x) calculation using linear interpolation
  - Fixed-point arithmetic with banker's rounding
  - Approximates logarithm values between known points

- **Prob. C - Synthesis Comparison Study**:
  - Comparison of gate-level vs behavioral implementations in Lab2
  - Performance analysis
